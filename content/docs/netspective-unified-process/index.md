# Netspective Unified Process

**An Agile Quality System & SDLC for Regulated IT Deliverables**

Regulated software requires more than just code—it demands documented, auditable processes that meet FDA, HIPAA, NIST, and other regulatory standards. NUP provides the complete framework your team needs, ready to integrate into your quality management system.

## Why Regulated Software Needs a Documented Quality System

If your software touches healthcare data, medical devices, government systems, or life sciences research, regulators require proof that you follow documented, repeatable processes. Ad-hoc development isn't acceptable.

*   **Regulatory Mandates:** FDA, HIPAA, NIST, and ONC all require documented software development processes with audit trails.
*   **Audit Readiness:** When auditors arrive, you need organized documentation proving every decision and verification step.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Documented processes reduce errors, improve quality, and protect against compliance violations.

### The Compliance Gap

Many teams struggle to bridge the gap between modern agile development and regulatory compliance requirements. They either:

*   Move fast but create compliance debt that haunts them during audits
*   Slow down dramatically with heavyweight waterfall processes
*   Cobble together ad-hoc documentation that doesn't satisfy auditors

**NUP solves this by providing an agile framework designed from the ground up for regulatory compliance.**
