title: The Praxis
description: A living manifesto for the AI age, focused on helping humans transition from the old world of work to the new.
---

Welcome to **The Praxis**, our engineering community's living guide to how we work and the principles that guide our decisions.

The word **"praxis"** means the process of using a theory or lesson in a practical way. This repository isn't a rulebook—it's a collection of our shared understandings, doctrines, and manifestos that help us navigate our work and our mission together.

## Key Directives

Explore our core manifestos and doctrines that guide our AI-native approach:

### Trustable AI Interactions Engineering Manifesto

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is structured to be a source of truth and inspiration, not a list of rigid policies. You'll find:

- **Manifestos:** The core beliefs and mission that drive us in the age of AI
- **Doctrines:** High-level philosophies and conceptual frameworks for human-AI collaboration
- **Guiding Principles:** Actionable guidelines that help us make decisions and collaborate effectively with AI
- **Operating Guidelines:** Practical advice and best practices for day-to-day operations in a human-AI workflow

## How to Use Praxis

- **As a Compass:** Use these documents to help orient yourself, especially when facing a new or ambiguous situation involving AI
- **As a Reference:** If you're ever unsure about our stance on a particular topic, this is the place to start
- **As a Collaborative Tool:** The Praxis is a living document. We encourage you to contribute to discussions, suggest improvements, and help us refine our collective understanding as the world of AI continues to evolve

## The Genesis: Navigating the AI Transition

The Praxis was born in the early days of the AI revolution, specifically as we began to grapple with the profound shift from a purely human-centric world to one of human-AI collaboration. Our initial doctrines and manifestos were created to help us understand and manage the transition from traditional, human-focused corporate and B2B engineering to a new paradigm where humans and AI (specifically LLMs) must interact seamlessly.

A core assumption of The Praxis is that AI will progressively take on more and more heavy lifting. Therefore, a primary focus of these documents is to help our team transition from the "old world" to the "new world," offering guidance on how to evolve our roles, skills, and perspectives in a world transformed by artificial intelligence.
