> by Shahid N. Shah

The _AI-native Technical Communications Doctrine_ addresses a profound shift in how technical information is created, delivered, and consumed. For decades, documentation has been written with the assumption that a human would be its first and primary reader. Today, that assumption is no longer safe. Users are increasingly turning to AI assistants—whether embedded in a product, accessed through chat interfaces, or integrated into developer tools—as their primary source of technical answers. The doctrine recognizes this reality and offers a framework for creating documentation that is not only human-readable, but also optimized for ingestion, retrieval, and interpretation by large language models (LLMs).

This is not a call to discard traditional technical writing principles. Instead, it is about building on those principles and extending them for a new audience: the AI intermediary that will interpret and deliver your documentation to the end user. A document that is modular, explicit, and richly annotated will still be excellent for humans—but it will also be far more effective when processed by AI systems.

## The Doctrine

> Humans should leverage AI to write documentation with the assumption that your primary reader is an AI assistant.

When you write with the assumption that an AI assistant is your primary target, you create content that is structured, explicit, and modular enough for an LLM to ingest and faithfully relay to human users. This doesn’t make documentation any less important – on the contrary, it reinforces that **high-quality _human-produced_ documentation is the bedrock** on which reliable AI assistance is built. AI changes the medium of consumption, not the necessity of accurate information.

- Write for AI as the primary reader; humans benefit from the same clarity.
- Modularize content and maintain strict structure and terminology.
- Embed metadata and guidance to steer retrieval, tone, and safety.
- Pair great docs with guardrails, citations, and a feedback loop.
- Treat documentation updates as the primary antidote to hallucinations.
- Consider documentation an extension of product quality and support.

### Important Ideas

* **AI-first vs Human-first:** Traditional docs assumed a human would navigate and comprehend them; AI-first docs assume an intermediary (the AI) will do that job. This shift in audience calls for a more rigorous, structured approach to how we write.
* **Modularity and Structure:** Information should be packaged into standalone units (modules) with clear headings and boundaries. This makes retrieval precise and prevents context bleed. A well-structured doc is both easier for AI to parse *and* more efficient for humans to scan.
* **Write for Retrieval:** Every piece of documentation should anticipate how an AI might retrieve and use it. This means using explicit terms (avoiding pronoun ambiguity or undefined references), repeating key context where needed, and formatting content (lists, tables, code blocks) in consistent ways. Essentially, we optimize for “generative search” or GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) much like we used to for SEO.
* **Embedded Metadata and Prompts:** We enrich docs with metadata (frontmatter tags like version, audience, etc.) and even embedded AI cues (notes for how the AI should treat certain content). This metadata feeds the AI pipeline with additional context, enabling features like filtering by product version or adjusting answers for a user’s expertise level.
* **Accuracy and Guardrails:** We pair great documentation with guardrail instructions to the AI: don’t drift beyond the docs, don’t hallucinate missing info, always cite or double-check facts. And we continuously update docs when gaps or errors are revealed through AI interactions. The AI effectively becomes a real-time diagnostic of our documentation quality.
* **Human Alignment:** The doctrine does not sideline human readers; it aligns what’s good for AI with what’s good for humans. Clear, factual, well-organized documentation benefits everyone. Humans can still read the docs directly (and they will be better docs than before). The AI-first approach simply ensures that those same docs can be consumed by machines to serve humans in new, convenient ways (chatbots, voice, IDE assistants, etc.).
* **Cultural Change:** Adopting AI-first documentation is also about culture. Engineers and writers should think of documentation as part of the product’s AI training data. Writing a doc is, in effect, doing prompt engineering for every future AI that will read it. We have to instill this perspective: when you document a new feature, you’re not just writing for the next developer who reads the manual, you’re writing for the AI that will explain this feature to perhaps thousands of users over time.
* **Myth-busting:** We reaffirm that AI isn’t making docs obsolete – it’s making *how we deliver docs* smarter. Those who invest in AI-optimized documentation will find their users happier and their support burden lighter. Those who don’t may find their documentation “invisible” in an AI-driven support landscape (if the AI can’t parse it well, it won’t be used in answers, and your product might appear poorly documented in the AI’s eyes). It’s akin to the early days of web search – if you didn’t optimize for search engines, your content might as well not exist. Now, if you don’t optimize for LLMs, your docs risk not being surfaced.

## **Quick start**

If you’re looking to adopt this doctrine in your organization or project, here’s a high-level checklist of actions:

1. **Audit your existing documentation:** Evaluate how friendly it is to AI parsing. Are sections too long or covering multiple topics? Are key facts findable via keywords? Do you use consistent terminology? Identify areas to restructure.
2. **Modularize content:** Break docs into smaller pages or clearly marked sections. Use one heading per concept. Consider moving lengthy conceptual expositions to appendices, and keeping main docs crisp and fact-focused.
3. **Add frontmatter metadata:** Define a schema (title, description, version, product, audience, etc.) and add it to each doc file. Use kebab-case keys for consistency (as shown in our examples). This metadata will be useful even outside of AI (for example, for site generation or search indexing).
4. **Review language for explicitness:** Find and replace ambiguous references. Anywhere you see “it”, “this configuration”, “above/below”, make sure the referent is clear. This often means minor edits like changing “save it to apply changes” to “save the configuration file to apply changes”.
5. **Incorporate Q\&A and use-case snippets:** For each major feature or common issue, add a FAQ entry or a “How-to” article. It might feel repetitive if the info exists elsewhere, but it’s worth having these entry points. Think of the questions customers or team members frequently ask and ensure the doc literally contains those questions (and answers).
6. **Document error messages and edge cases:** Create a reference for errors, each with an explanation and resolution. Many projects neglect this, and it’s a prime area where AI can shine by giving immediate help. But only if the info is documented.
7. **Embed cautionary and contextual notes:** Identify any areas where an AI could give an answer that is technically correct but contextually risky (like a command that has dangerous side-effects). Make sure the doc around that command or topic includes warnings or notes that an AI would pick up. Use a consistent format for warnings (“**Warning:**” or similar) so it’s clearly marked.
8. **Implement an AI doc assistant internally:** Use tools like AnythingLLM or a custom pipeline to ingest your docs and try them out in a chat interface. Pilot this with the team. Observe what questions come up, and whether the doc-fed AI answers them well. This will directly show you where docs need improvement. It’s essentially a form of documentation testing.
9. **Train the team (“write for AI” mindset):** Educate your documentation contributors—be they technical writers or engineers—about these principles. Provide examples of good AI-oriented documentation vs. traditional. Perhaps create writing guidelines (like a style guide addendum) that codify things: “Always write in complete, stand-alone sentences for key facts”, “When introducing a new term, define it clearly in the same sentence”, “Prefer bullet lists for enumerations”, etc.
10. **Set up a feedback loop:** Once an AI assistant is live to users (even if just internal users or beta), set up a way to capture unanswered or mis-answered queries. Make reviewing those part of your documentation update process. It might be as simple as a shared log where team members paste bad outputs, or more sophisticated like analytics on what docs were retrieved and if the user asked a follow-up that indicates confusion.
11. **Keep documentation up-to-date:** This is obvious, but even more critical now. If the code changes or a new feature is added, the AI will still parrot whatever the docs say (or omit mentioning a new feature altogether). The lag between code and docs will surface directly to users asking questions. So align documentation updates with release cycles tightly. Use version tags in docs so the AI can differentiate answers for “current version” vs old, if needed.
12. **Monitor AI performance:** Periodically, do spot checks on the AI’s answers against the docs. Are there any hallucinations creeping in? Did it perhaps string together two doc pieces in a misleading way? Such issues might indicate the need for more explicit bridging text in docs or additional guardrail instructions to the AI. For example, if it tends to omit a prerequisite step, make that prerequisite more prominent in the doc.
13. **Cite sources in AI responses (if user-facing):** Configure the AI to provide source references (like footnotes with doc titles/links) in its answers. This not only builds trust, it also effectively advertises your documentation (“here’s where this answer came from”). It closes the loop for users who want deeper reading. Most importantly, it keeps the AI honest – it knows it should only say things that it can back up with a source snippet.
14. **Manage content scope:** Decide if your AI assistant will stick strictly to your official docs, or also use external data (forums, etc.). Early on, it’s wise to keep it to official docs to maintain accuracy. If users ask things not in docs, use that as impetus to improve docs. Over time, you might expand to include vetted external content if needed.

By following this guide, an organization can gradually transition to AI-first documentation without a huge one-time overhaul. It can start small (maybe just one product’s docs as a pilot) and expand. The move to AI-native documentation is an opportunity to elevate the quality and accessibility of our technical content. It demands rigor and foresight in how we write, but it promises a world where users (or engineers or any audience) can get the exact information they need from our documentation instantly and accurately, anytime, anywhere, through the AI interlocutor of their choice. By adopting the principles, practices, and checklists outlined in this doctrine, we can ensure our documentation isn’t just static text on a page, but a living, queryable, intelligent resource that works in tandem with the powerful AI tools of tomorrow.
