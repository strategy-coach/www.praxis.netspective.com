> *“Trust doesn’t come from getting it right the first time. It comes from learning publicly and visibly every time you get it wrong.”*

In AI-native systems, feedback loops are the operating system of trust. They are the core mechanism by which systems shift from "demo-grade intelligence" to "production-grade reliability." While most teams focus on model selection, prompt engineering, or grounding strategies, those only create the *illusion* of stability. True trust is built through continuous, structured, and observable learning from users — especially in systems built for high-stakes, B2B domains.

This section defines how we engineer feedback loops into our stack — using `surveilr`, SQL, Model Context Protocols (MCPs), Qualityfolio, and prompt-time intelligence — to build *self-improving*, *auditable*, and *trust-reinforcing* systems.

## Why Static Prompt Engineering Isn't Enough

LLMs are probabilistic machines. They are context-dependent, non-deterministic, and subject to drift. In real-world deployments, expectations shift, source content changes, and users phrase things in unpredictable ways.

Without live feedback mechanisms, product teams default to:

* Manual prompt tuning
* Emergency RAG patches
* Opaque fine-tunes that can't be traced back to user impact

This approach breaks down at scale, especially when dealing with regulated systems, customer-facing agents, or knowledge domains that evolve rapidly (e.g., security policies, vendor docs, HR manuals).

We must move from prompt tuning to feedback tuning.

Here is an extended version of the section titled:

## Feedback Loops Beyond LLMs: A Return to First Principles

While modern AI systems benefit from real-time prompt-level feedback, it’s essential to remember that feedback loops are not new — they’ve long been central to improving intelligent systems. The AI industry spent years developing reinforcement learning (RL), where agents learn to take actions in environments to maximize rewards.

In classic Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a model is tuned over time using rewards derived from user preferences — either implicit (clicks, retention) or explicit (surveys, corrections).

However, in production B2B environments, full-blown RLHF is often too costly, slow, and opaque to deploy regularly. Instead, we adapt its best ideas:

* Reward models are replaced by structured Qualityfolio outcomes (e.g., a test passes → reward; a test fails → penalty).
* Environment state is the context window + prompt + grounding source.
* Actions are the generated answers or interactions from the AI agent.
* Policy tuning becomes prompt refinement or data scope adjustment.

This mental model allows us to simulate RLHF at the UX level, without expensive fine-tuning loops, by using structured UAT feedback and SQL-based pattern recognition over time.

## Designing Feedback Loops into Traditional Web Interfaces

We must also extend feedback loops beyond AI answers — to improve not just the model, but the entire product, support experience, and documentation system.

Here’s how we embed AI-native feedback into existing websites, apps, customer portals, and internal tools:

### Inline Feedback Widgets

Embed “Was this helpful?” or “Something wrong?” buttons on:

* Knowledge base articles
* Tooltips
* Support search results
* AI-generated content (e.g., “Explain this invoice” or “Summarize this ticket”)

Instead of binary responses, provide structured follow-ups:

* “Outdated information”
* “Wrong for my use case”
* “Needs more detail”
  Each selection becomes a structured entry in surveilr.

### Session Summary Snapshots

At the end of complex support sessions, show a summary with:

* The user’s queries
* System responses
* Key documents cited
* A single “Rate this interaction” or “Suggest corrections” modal

Even a few submissions per week can signal major blind spots — and produce testable UATs.

### Embedded Annotation Tools for Internal Teams

In enterprise systems, your internal QA, customer success, or SME teams are the most critical feedback providers. Give them:

* Google Docs-style commenting on AI output
* Comment tagging (e.g., "noncompliant", "missed clause", "confusing wording")
* Ability to promote feedback directly to test cases or UATs

These annotations flow into `surveilr` and inform both retraining and trust dashboards.

### Passive Feedback Telemetry

Use session analytics to infer dissatisfaction:

* Repeated phrasing changes or reformulations
* Switching to manual input (e.g., escaping an assistant)
* Sudden page exits or bounce during guided flows

Correlate these behaviors with prompts and document versions to identify failure modes over time.

## ssigning Responsibility for Feedback Management

Without ownership, feedback loops fail.

Here is a breakdown of who owns what in our trustable system feedback architecture:

| Role                     | Feedback Responsibility                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner        | Define what feedback types matter most to business value (e.g., compliance vs UX).    |
| UX/Design Lead       | Embed structured and intuitive feedback capture tools into all relevant screens.      |
| QA/Test Engineers    | Review feedback for inclusion in Qualityfolio as new UAT cases or test assertions.    |
| Documentation Owners | Review content-based feedback and version updates to ensure grounded accuracy.        |
| Context Engineers    | Adjust context shaping logic or documents included in prompts based on patterns.      |
| Data Analysts        | Run surveilr SQL queries to visualize feedback trends and monitor performance.        |
| AI Integrations Lead | Tune prompt templates, revise MCPs, and log context-response chains for traceability. |
| SME Reviewers        | Act as final authority for content-level corrections and trust enforcement.           |

This matrix guarantees that feedback is not treated as noise, but as a first-class product artifact with lifecycle management.

## Feedback-Driven Product Evolution as a Business Differentiator

Ultimately, feedback loops are not just for model optimization — they are product strategy.

They:

* Surface real-world edge cases faster than any requirements doc
* Reveal gaps in documentation, training, and business processes
* Enable proactive QA and compliance enforcement
* Build customer confidence by showing that the product *learns and adapts*

We treat feedback loops as circular pipelines where:

1. Every user interaction is treated as potential signal.
2. All signal is structured, stored, and categorized in `surveilr`.
3. Engineers and QA derive testable improvements via Qualityfolio.
4. Updates are traced, tested, and fed back into future interactions.

This evidence-driven learning loop is our competitive moat. It ensures our AI systems aren’t just compliant and explainable — they’re actively evolving, just like our customers’ needs.

## Types of Feedback We Engineer for

We treat every interaction — not just those marked with 👍 or 👎 — as feedback.

Structured Feedback

* UAT test failures (from Qualityfolio)
* Categorized dissatisfaction ("wrong tone", "incomplete", "not cited", etc.)
* Inline annotations from internal review teams

Implicit Feedback

* Follow-up clarification queries
* Abandonment events
* Copy-paste behavior (did the user copy or rephrase?)

Contextual Signals

* Document version in context
* Confidence score in MCP logs
* Known gaps in grounding coverage

We use these to create feedback bundles, each with:

* The original user expectation or test case (from `surveilr`)
* The full context window, prompts, and cited documents
* Categorized evaluation of what went wrong (stored in surveilr as metadata)

This structured design allows the system to learn like a professional QA team would, not just blindly retry responses.

## How surveilr Supports Feedback-Driven Trust Engineering

`surveilr` is our AI Memory Middleware. It stores every interaction as relational memory:

* Prompt → Output → Trustworthiness tags → Correction or Feedback
* All feedback entries are SQL queryable inside RSSD (Resource Surveillance State Database)

That means we can:

* Run trust audits:
  `SELECT * FROM ai_interactions WHERE trust_rating < 0.7 AND document_version = 'v3.1';`
* Retrieve only feedback related to specific clients, versions, or failure types
* Auto-create test cases in Qualityfolio based on repeated feedback patterns

This allows us to triage, visualize, and close loops on trust erosion — not just at the UX level, but deep in the LLM’s operational context.

## Feedback Loop Engineering Patterns

### Context Injection (Lightweight, Immediate)

* Use `surveilr` to detect a recurring failure mode
* Update MCP prompt templates with new instructions:

  > “If the user asks about travel policy, clarify the version in force.”

This is cheap, safe, and instantly testable via Qualityfolio.

### Prompt-Time Similarity Recall

* Use surveilr + SQLite full-text search or embedding-enhanced `vanna.ai` style agents to match current user input to similar previously failed prompts
* Inject the corrected response or override known bad behavior

This avoids re-learning the same mistake, and reinforces correctness over time.

### Qualityfolio Replay as Regression Coverage

* Convert feedback entries to test cases
* Automatically schedule UAT runs to verify improved responses
* Keep all failures linked to underlying expectations and document sources

This makes the entire feedback system a self-validating QA loop.

## Trust-Driven Prioritization: Not All Feedback is Equal

We tag feedback with:

* Source criticality (UAT, casual user, domain SME)
* Document criticality (internal policy vs. marketing blurb)
* Version awareness (which doc/version was used)
* Trust leakage indicators (e.g., hallucinations, non-cited output)

This allows us to prioritize engineering actions based on trust weight, not popularity:

> A failure in SOC2 UAT from a compliance officer weighs more than 20 casual thumbs-downs from test users.

## Manifesto Engineering Practices

To embody these principles, our teams follow these practices:

* Every output must be traceable to its inputs (prompt, documents, context, citations)
* Every UAT failure becomes a ticket or test case, tracked in Qualityfolio and grounded in SQL
* All feedback is stored as structured content in `surveilr`, versioned and auditable
* No changes to prompts, MCPs, or fine-tunes are made without a clear link to recorded feedback
* Feedback loops are built into onboarding — not just post-launch firefighting

## Feedback Is The Product

In AI-native systems, feedback is not telemetry — it's the raw material of trust.

The smartest systems are not the ones that avoid mistakes, but the ones that learn visibly, consistently, and verifiably — and then prove it via passing UATs and grounded responses.

We don’t just ship models.
We ship closed feedback loops that make trust a continuous property — not a one-time assertion.
