## What we mean by "Trust" in AI-Native B2B Systems

In this architecture, we use the term "trustworthy AI" with a very specific and operational definition that differs from its broader use in public discourse. We do not refer to ethical AI, bias mitigation, fairness, or any societal or philosophical constructs associated with trust in AI systems at large.

Instead, *trustworthy*, in our context, means "grounded in B2B source documents and verifiable through citation."

### Trust = Alignment to Internal Business Knowledge

We are not building general-purpose chatbots or consumer-facing question-answering systems. We are engineering internal-facing systems for B2B users - professionals who rely on company-specific documentation, policies, procedures, contracts, workflows, and internal standards.

For us, trustworthiness is achieved when AI interactions and answers are:

* Accurate in the context of the B2B documents provided
* Verifiably traceable to specific sections, clauses, or artifacts within those documents
* Structured in such a way that any reviewer - human or auditor - can identify where the knowledge originated and validate that it was used appropriately

We do not assume the AI "knows" anything outside the B2B document corpus unless explicitly designed to.

### What Trust Does *Not* Mean in This System

To prevent confusion, it’s important to clarify that we do not conflate our notion of trust with:

* Global factual correctness (e.g., “what is the capital of Brazil”)
* Ethical fairness (e.g., equitable treatment of individuals or populations) outside of what B2B and regulatory policies have been provided
* Moral reasoning or societal implications outside of what B2B and regulatory policies have been provided
* Open-domain truth-seeking
* Emotional or interpersonal trust

These are important concepts in other AI contexts - but they are *not* the domain of this system.

Our users do not ask our AI, "What is the truth?" They ask, "What does our company’s onboarding policy say?" or "What refund rules are in the current SLA?" That distinction is central to our architecture.

### Grounded Trust Comes from Structured B2B Content

The source of truth in this system is the B2B knowledge base, meticulously converted into structured, provenance-enriched Markdown or semantically rich HTML. Trust emerges when:

* The system interacts and provides answers a question solely based on that body of material
* The answer includes a reference to the specific clause or section it came from
* The citation is deterministic and stable (e.g., pointing to `refund-policy_sec-5_paragraph-3`)
* The user can open that source and confirm it matches the response

In this model, the documents are the ground. AI is the interpreter - not the originator - of that knowledge.

### Trustable Interactions

When we say "Trustable Interactions" in this whitepaper, we are referring to:

> The AI's ability to faithfully reflect and cite B2B documents as the source of its interactions and answers.

Not ethics. Not opinions. Not general facts.

Only what is in the documentation.

This distinction anchors every technical decision - from document transformation to prompt construction to output verification - and should remain the lens through which we evaluate all AI behavior in this system.
