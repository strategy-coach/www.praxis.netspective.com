title: Project Delivery Leaders Shift-Left Checklist
description: Transform from ticket coordinators to AI-powered solution architects with executable specifications.
---

**Purpose:** Transform from ticket coordinators → AI-powered solution architects by producing executable specifications and working prototypes before development starts.

## Pre-Sprint Planning (Both Legacy & AI Apps)

**System Understanding**
* [ ] Generate **comprehensive system documentation** using AI analysis of existing codebases
* [ ] Create **architectural diagrams** with current data flows and dependencies
* [ ] Identify **technical debt hotspots** with AI-generated priority rankings and remediation costs
* [ ] Map **external system dependencies** with API specifications and failure scenarios
* [ ] Document **performance baselines** and capacity constraints for existing systems

**Specification Creation**
* [ ] Write **acceptance criteria as executable prompts** (include API payloads, UI states, error handling)
* [ ] Generate **working prototypes** for core functionality using AI tools
* [ ] Create **integration specifications** with sample requests, responses, and error codes
* [ ] Design **data migration scripts** and validation procedures (for legacy integrations)
* [ ] Establish **monitoring and observability requirements** with specific metrics and alerts

## AI-Specific Pre-Sprint Planning

**Model & Prompt Management**
* [ ] Create **prompt libraries** with versioned templates for core AI functionality
* [ ] Define **model performance benchmarks** (accuracy, latency, cost per operation)
* [ ] Generate **comprehensive test datasets** covering edge cases and bias scenarios
* [ ] Establish **safety guardrails** (content filtering, privacy protection, hallucination detection)
* [ ] Design **A/B testing frameworks** for prompt optimization and model comparison

**AI Integration Architecture**
* [ ] Generate **end-to-end workflow simulations** using multi-agent scenarios
* [ ] Create **cost estimation models** based on token usage and processing volume
* [ ] Design **fallback procedures** for AI service failures or performance degradation
* [ ] Establish **compliance frameworks** (GDPR, HIPAA, bias auditing) with automated checks
* [ ] Plan **continuous learning pipelines** for model improvement and retraining triggers

## Legacy-Specific Pre-Sprint Planning

**Legacy System Analysis**
* [ ] Perform **automated code analysis** to identify refactoring opportunities and security vulnerabilities
* [ ] Generate **data quality assessments** with cleansing scripts and migration procedures
* [ ] Create **integration compatibility matrices** showing system interaction patterns and constraints
* [ ] Design **strangler fig migration strategies** with incremental replacement timelines
* [ ] Establish **rollback procedures** and compatibility testing for each legacy integration

**Modernization Planning**
* [ ] Generate **API specifications** for legacy system modernization with backward compatibility
* [ ] Create **performance optimization recommendations** based on current system bottlenecks
* [ ] Design **monitoring dashboards** for legacy system health and integration status
* [ ] Plan **incremental deployment strategies** with feature flags and traffic routing
* [ ] Document **knowledge transfer procedures** for maintaining AI-generated documentation

## During Sprint Execution

**Continuous Validation**
* [ ] Monitor **prototype performance** against established benchmarks and adjust specifications
* [ ] Update **living documentation** as system changes are implemented
* [ ] Validate **integration points** using AI-generated test scenarios and edge case coverage
* [ ] Track **technical debt metrics** and prioritize remediation based on business impact
* [ ] Review **AI model performance** and optimize prompts based on real-world usage patterns

**Team Support**
* [ ] Provide **just-in-time specifications** when developers encounter edge cases or ambiguities
* [ ] Generate **troubleshooting guides** for common integration and deployment issues
* [ ] Create **onboarding materials** for new team members using AI-generated system summaries
* [ ] Facilitate **knowledge sharing** through searchable prompt libraries and prototype repositories
* [ ] Coordinate **stakeholder demonstrations** using working prototypes rather than static presentations

## Post-Sprint Review & Optimization

**Performance Analysis**
* [ ] Analyze **delivery metrics** (velocity, defect rates, rework cycles) and identify improvement opportunities
* [ ] Review **AI model performance** in production and update benchmarks based on real usage
* [ ] Assess **technical debt evolution** and update prioritization based on system changes
* [ ] Evaluate **integration stability** and refine monitoring alerts and escalation procedures
* [ ] Document **lessons learned** and update prompt libraries and specification templates

**Continuous Improvement**
* [ ] Refine **AI prompts and templates** based on development team feedback and outcomes
* [ ] Update **architectural documentation** to reflect system changes and new integration patterns
* [ ] Optimize **prototype generation processes** to reduce time from concept to working demo
* [ ] Enhance **team training materials** with new AI tools and delivery techniques
* [ ] Plan **knowledge transfer sessions** to share successful patterns across delivery teams

## Critical Success Indicators

**Delivery Acceleration**
* [ ] Development teams receive **executable specifications** rather than abstract requirements
* [ ] **Zero ambiguity tickets**: Every story includes working examples and clear success criteria
* [ ] **Prototype-first planning**: Major features begin with AI-generated working demos
* [ ] **Living documentation**: System specifications update automatically as code changes
* [ ] **Predictive issue identification**: Problems surface during planning, not during development

**Quality Assurance**
* [ ] **Comprehensive test coverage**: AI-generated test scenarios cover functional and edge cases
* [ ] **Performance validation**: System capacity and response time requirements verified before coding
* [ ] **Security assessment**: Vulnerability scanning and compliance checks integrated into specifications
* [ ] **Integration testing**: Cross-system interactions validated through AI-generated scenarios
* [ ] **Rollback readiness**: Every deployment includes tested procedures for safe reversion

## Emergency Protocols

**When AI Tools Fail**
* [ ] Maintain **manual fallback procedures** for critical specification generation tasks
* [ ] Keep **template libraries** for common patterns when AI generation is unavailable
* [ ] Have **alternative AI providers** configured for essential prototype generation workflows
* [ ] Document **manual override processes** for time-sensitive delivery commitments

**When Prototypes Mislead**
* [ ] Establish **validation checkpoints** to verify prototype accuracy against real system constraints
* [ ] Create **feedback loops** between development teams and prototype generation processes
* [ ] Maintain **version control** for all generated specifications and prototypes
* [ ] Design **quick pivot procedures** when prototypes reveal incorrect assumptions

**Reminder:** If delivery leaders hand off tickets without executable prompts, working prototypes, and comprehensive specifications, the story isn't ready for development. **Shift left = no development without AI-generated validation and concrete examples.**
